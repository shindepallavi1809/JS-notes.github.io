        <h3>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the <br>ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,<br> 
            and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based <br>object-orientation, and first-class functions.</h3>

              <h1>Functions</h1><br>
              <p>In JavaScript, as in other languages, we can create functions. A function is a kind of mini-program that forms part of a larger program.            </p>

              <p>As well as needing to assign values to variables, we sometime need to compare variables or literals.            </p>

                  <p> An object is a set of variables, functions, etc., that are in some way related. They are grouped together and given a 
                      name Objects may have:</p>

                  <p>In addition to the objects we have already encountered, there are a number of other objects that form part of the 
                      JavaScript language. Among the more important and useful of these are the Date and Math objects.</p>

                  <p>JavaScript includes a String object that allow us to manipulate strings in a variety of ways, for example, searching a 
                      string to see if it contains certain patterns of letters, extracting part of it to form new string, and much more.</p>
